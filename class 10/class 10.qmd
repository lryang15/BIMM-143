## The PDB database

First let's see what is in the PDB database- the main repository of protein structures. 

Downloaded composition stats from: https://www.rcsb.org

```{r}
pdb <- "Data Export Summary.csv"
stats <- read.csv(pdb, row.names = 1)
stats
```

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
x
```

There is a problem here due to the commas in the numbers. This causes R to treat them as characters. 

Substitute without commas `gsub()`

```{r}
gsub(",", "", x)
```

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x){
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}
```

```{r}
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```

I can also use `apply()` to fix the whole table...

```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, MARGIN = 2, FUN= rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
head(stats)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(pdbstats[,"Total"]/ sum(pdbstats[, "Total"]) *100, 2)
```


>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED for time!!!

Protein structures in PDB as a fraction of UniProt sequences

```{r}
round((pdbstats[1, "Total"]/251600768)*100, 2)
```

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

This is a 2 angstrom structure and hydrogen is not visible at this resolution. You need 1 angstrom or better to be able to see small atoms like hydrogen 

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

Water HOH 308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb1 <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb1
```

```{r}
head(pdb1$atom)
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motions of a PDB structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
